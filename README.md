# english_to_bengali_translation_with_gpt-4o
Fine-tuning GPT-4o for English-to-Bengali translation using a dataset from the PMIndia Parallel Corpus.

# About the project
Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) - GPT-4o for English-to-Bengali translation using a dataset from the PMIndia Parallel Corpus.
This is a Google Colab notebook to use GPT-4o for translating English text to Bengali. The data is first checked for duplicates and then fine-tuned using a subset of English-to-Bengali translation pairs from the PMIndia Parallel Corpus. A simple UI is used to handle the user input (prompt in English) and display the response (Bengali translation).

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include the OpenAI Chat Completions API, python-dotenv, ipywidgets, and IPython.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of using and fine-tuning ChatGPT for translation.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with the ChatGPT APIs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning LLMs, and language translation, an clone or download the project to get started.

# References
I have leveraged ChatGPT for guidance in terms of some concepts and to clarify doubts, both theoretical and code-based. However, I did not use ChatGPT to generate code. I have also found the following courses from DeepLearning.AI quite useful to get started with.
1. [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/).
2. [Building Systems with the ChatGPT API](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/building-systems-with-chatgpt/).

# Additional Notes
1. The dataset is available on Kaggle [here](https://data.statmt.org/pmindia/v1/parallel/). If the dataset is taken down in the future, please feel free to reach out to me at ankanatwork@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about the data. However, I may not be able to share the dataset with you due to licensing restrictions.
2. The project is a basic one in nature and is not currently being maintained.
